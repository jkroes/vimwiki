<p>TODO: Add to this by reading <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org" class="uri">https://ggplot2-book.org</a></p>
<p>TODO: Use geom_hline instead of geom_line for a dataset variable TODO: Use scale_*_identity and a data variable for thresholds in figures TODO: Use a base ggplot object and <code>+ aes(...)</code> and <code>%+% &lt;data&gt;</code> instead of repeated functions calls. Use your knowledge of scales and theme to simplify figures. TODO: Source sections of the report to reduce size if possible</p>
<p>Every use of ggplot2 begins with a call to ggplot() followed by one or more calls to geom and stat layers; scales; themes; coords; annotations and/or facets. separated by the <code>+</code> infix operator.</p>
<p>= Primary functions =</p>
<p>ggplot(df, aes(x,y,…)) Set the default data for all layers to plot and aesthetics. Data and aesthetics can be overridden in individual layers. No defaults need be provided, so ggplot() is a valid function call.</p>
<p>aes(x,y,…) Create an aesthetic mapping. Aesthetic mappings describe how data variables map to visual properties of geoms. The arguments to aes() are name-value pairs in the form <code>aesthetic=variable</code>, though x and y (if x is present) may be given as positional arguments. Variables are evaluated within the context of the layer’s data (the default data if no layer data is specified). Variables may also be expressions involving variables or constants.</p>
<p>e1 + e2 Used to add plot components to a theme or ggplot object. Components can be an <em>aes() object to</em> <em>override the default aesthetics</em>, a layer (geom, stat, or position-adjustment), a scale, a theme, a coord, or a facet.</p>
<p>e1 %+% e2 Used to <em>override the default data</em> of a ggplot object. <code>e2</code> is the new default data to use.</p>
<p>ggsave Save a plot, by default the last plot displayed.</p>
<p>= Example =</p>
<p>This example shows three ways of specifying different mappings for different datasets. ds and df contain a common variable (gp) for the x-axis but different variables (y and mean) for the y-axis.</p>
<p>{{{r # Generate some sample data, then compute mean and standard deviation # in each group df &lt;- data.frame( gp = factor(rep(letters[1:3], each = 10)), y = rnorm(30) ) ds &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(split(df, df<span class="math inline">\(gp), function(d) {  data.frame(mean = mean(d\)</span>y), sd = sd(d<span class="math inline">\(y), gp = d\)</span>gp) }))</p>
<p># The summary data frame ds is used to plot larger red points on top # of the raw data. Note that we don’t need to supply <code>data</code> or <code>mapping</code> # in each layer because the defaults from ggplot() are used. ggplot(df, aes(gp, y)) + geom_point() + geom_point(data = ds, aes(y = mean), colour = ‘red’, size = 3)</p>
<p># Same plot as above, declaring only the data frame in ggplot(). # Note how the x and y aesthetics must now be declared in # each geom_point() layer. ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(gp, y)) + geom_point(data = ds, aes(gp, mean), colour = ‘red’, size = 3)</p>
<p># Alternatively we can fully specify the plot in each layer. This # is not useful here, but can be more clear when working with complex # mult-dataset graphics ggplot() + geom_point(data = df, aes(gp, y)) + geom_point(data = ds, aes(gp, mean), colour = ‘red’, size = 3) + }}}</p>
<p>= Layers =</p>
<p><em>Unlike ggplot(), layers have aes() as their first argument, so data</em> <em>must be a named argument to be used in the first position.</em></p>
<p>== Geoms ==</p>
<p>Described as a combination of data, aesthetic mapping, a geometric object, a statistical transformation, and a position adjustment.</p>
<p>== Stats ==</p>
<p>Some of these are specified as layers to be called in lieu of geoms, while others are shown in the documentation as the value of a geom’s <code>stat</code> argument–not as a function call but as a string that isn’t always the full function name. It is unclear if the functions can be used as well.</p>
<p>== Position ==</p>
<p>Though the documentation initially seems to classify these as independent layers, they are only ever used as the value of arguments to a geom in the examples. In some cases, these may be specified as string arguments to the position argument of a geom; however, the function calls as the value of position seem more common. Unlike stats, these don’t ever seem to be used in lieu of a geom. Some examples show helper functions that can replace a position function call with an argument (e.g., position_nudge and nudge_y).</p>
<p>Functions like position_dodge can be used to position overlapping objects such as bar charts that share the same point on the x-axis. position_dodge requires the group aesthetic. I have not tested yet whether other aesthetics can fill in for the group aesthetic, or whether the latter must be explicitly included.</p>
<p>== Annotations ==</p>
<p>See abline, hline, and vline.</p>
<p>= Aesthetics =</p>
<p>Individual aesthetics are the arguments passed to aes(). Note that not all aesthetic specs apply to each layer. The layer’s help doc should list the applicable args to aes(). E.g., the geom_map layer doesn’t accept x and y aesthetics but does require x and y columns in the dataset passed to its map arg.</p>
<p>See [[<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html" class="uri">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html</a>]] for a guide to aesthetics common to many layers.</p>
<p>== Data types ==</p>
<p>Most aesthetics map to discrete variables.</p>
<p>x and y map to continuous, discrete, and date/time/datetime variables. There is a scale for converting continuous to binned data: <code>scale_(x|y)_binned</code>.</p>
<p>Colour and fill also map to binned and continuous variables, which makes sense given that the color scale can be represented as individual colors or as a gradient.</p>
<p>Alpha provides a continuous function that does nothing but abort and provide a warning message, while its discrete function shares a warning and secretly calls the ordinal function. Alpha is the only aesthetic with an ordinal function, perhaps because it is the only aesthetic that is commonly represented as a numeric scale, from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).</p>
<p>Size has a binned scale that can be used to assign sizes to continuous data. Other aesthetics like shape and linetype offer binned functions as well but warn that they shouldn’t be used because, unlike continuous data, shape and linetype don’t have an inherent order.</p>
<p>=== Discrete data ===</p>
<p>Discrete data seems to encompass both numeric-discrete and categorical-nominal data. In most cases, it likely also encompasses categorical-ordinal data, though the alpha scales treat ordinal data separately from other discrete data.</p>
<p>== Group ==</p>
<p>ggplot creates groups based on any discrete (categorical?) variables mapped to the axes (x and y aesthetics) or aesthetics such as shape and fill. These groups, however, also affect statistical transformations such as boxplot and smooth. For examples of this behavior, see <a href="https://www.gl-li.com/2017/08/13/ggplot2-group-overrides-default-grouping/" class="uri">https://www.gl-li.com/2017/08/13/ggplot2-group-overrides-default-grouping/</a></p>
<p>This link gives the example of mapping color based to year. In the example, there are two years and a categorical x-axis. Specifying a year-based color doubles the number of boxplots. This may not be the desired behavior–what if you want the original number of boxplots with year-based coloration of the points within each boxplot?</p>
<p>It helps to look at the code in the link, but the cause in the example is that the aesthetic specification is specified in ggplot() and thus inherited by every layer, including stat_boxplot. The first example can be solved by moving <code>color = factor(year)</code> to within a call to aes within geom_jitter. That way it doesn’t affect stat_boxplot.</p>
<p>Another solution involves overriding the default group within the desired layer. E.g., stat_boxplot(aes(group=drv)) gives the desired grouping, stat_boxplot(aes(group=interaction(drv, year))) recreates the default grouping, and stat_boxplot(aes(group=123)) has no grouping. Notice that the use of a constant instead of a variable eliminates grouping, leading to a single boxplot. Note that multiple variables must be wrapped in a call to <code>interaction()</code>.</p>
<p>=== Comparison to ggplot2 docs ===</p>
<p>The package documentation doesn’t explain any of the above; however, it provide examples that confirm the above. In <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_group_order.html" class="uri">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_group_order.html</a> an example is given for geom_line of grouping. With the default group based on age and height (i.e., no grouping because both variables are continuous), all points are connected by a line. If group=Subject is used, however, only within-Subject observations are connected by a line.</p>
<p>=== Individual vs collective geoms ===</p>
<p>In short, the group aesthetic only affects collective geoms (e.g., line, path, boxplot), which display a single object for multiple rows, in contrast to individual geoms (e.g., point). However, some geoms retain features of individual geoms. E.g., a path composed of points with different colors will have segments with different colors. In contrast, a polygon uses the same color for all segments. See the link for a visual example of this.</p>
<p>See also [[<a href="https://rpubs.com/hadley/ggplot2-toolbox%7Cthis" class="uri">https://rpubs.com/hadley/ggplot2-toolbox|this</a> article by Hadley Wickham]] for more on this topic, as well as a list of extensions to ggplot.</p>
<p>= Scales =</p>
<p>Scales detail how to map data variables to aesthetics. Unlike layers, there can only be one particular type of scale at a time. Each call to the same scale function will override the previous scale.</p>
<p>TODO: Test this with various helper functions and scales, both with similar and different arguments. E.g. labs(title=, subtitle=) and ggtitle() probably override each other; as would labs(x=), xlabs(), and scale_x_continuous(name=). At least I believe that the helper functions and scales can override each other. It is unclear if only similar arguments override each other, or if each call to a scale or helper function overwrites previous ones entirely.</p>
<p>Not all aesthetics have an associated scale function. The following do: alpha, x, y, colour, fill, linetype, size/radius, and shape.</p>
<p>Scale functions are named as scale_<aesthetic>_<data-type> for the most part, though many functions break with this convention by using aliases for data type or omitting it altogether (i.e., the colour scales).</p>
<p>There are also scale functions that allow for exact specification of the mapping between data types and the values/properties of an aesthetic: scale_<em><em>manual and scale</em></em>_identity (see below).</p>
<p>== Ellipsis arguments ==</p>
<p>Most scales have positional arguments <code>...</code> that are passed on to an internal function. The description of <code>...</code> specifies which function, and the source code of a scale function and the function it calls reveal what those arguments are.</p>
<p>E.g., one example for <code>scale_alpha</code> passes a string as the only (positional) argument. The source code of <code>scale_alpha</code> passes <code>...</code> as the fourth argument to <code>continous_scale</code>, whose fourth argument is name.</p>
<p>E.g., labs() notes that its <code>...</code> is a list of name-value pairs, where the name is the aesthetic. The value is a title for an axis (x or y) or a legend (e.g., colour).</p>
<p>== Colour/fill scales ==</p>
<p>The color and fill aesthetics are categorized below because there are many related scales whose data types are not always obvious from the scale names.</p>
<p>Several colour/fill scales support continuous, binned, and discrete data: * colorbrewer.org scales, ending in brewer, distiller, and fermenter * viridis scales</p>
<p>Continuous scales: * scale_<em><em>continuous (defaults to gradient; can use viridis) * scale</em></em>_gradient[2|n]</p>
<p>Binned scales: * scale_*_steps[2|n]</p>
<p>Discrete scales: * scale_<em><em>grey * scale</em></em>_hue</p>
<p>== Identity scales ==</p>
<p>Identity scales are provided for cases when you map an aesthetic to a variable that holds values for the aesthetic. Normally the value of a mapped variable only indicates grouping, but aesthetic-valued variables can be used both to group and control scaling. There are identity scales for colour, fill, shape, linetype, alpha, and size. There are also generalized identity scales for discrete and continuous variables. The generalized scales accept an aesthetics argument and can be used to provide the same values to multiple aesthetics (e.g.. colour and fill)</p>
<p>== Manual scales ==</p>
<p>If your dataset doesn’t contain the values of the aesthetic but you still want to create your own discrete scale, use scale_*_manual. Except for scale_continuous_identity, all identity scales have a manual counterpart. The primary argument is a named vector, where the names are values of your variable and the values are aesthetic values.</p>
<p>== Limits ==</p>
<p>Helper functions lims(), xlim(), and ylim() are shortcuts for the limits argument to scale functions.</p>
<p>Using lims(), xlim(), ylim(), or the limits argument of the scale functions replaces data outside of the limits with NA. To change axis limits without dropping data, see coord_cartesian(). The difference shows up e.g. when using geom_smooth and other statistical transformations.</p>
<p>lims() doesn’t just affect x- and y-axes. It can also be used with grouping variables to extend the axes beyond the values within the data.</p>
<p>{{{r small &lt;- subset(mtcars, cyl == 4)</p>
<p>ggplot(small, aes(mpg, wt, colour = factor(cyl))) + geom_point() + lims(colour = c(“4”, “6”, “8”)) }}}</p>
<p>If you want to ensure that the axes include a certain point or range, use expand_limits(). If the specified value(s) falls outside the data range, the axes will be extended to include it/them. Otherwise, the axes are unchanged. Like lims(), the extent of grouping variables can be specified. Unlike lims(), the extent is not fixed and may be larger than intended if the dataset has a larger range than that specified to expand_limits.</p>
<p>In contrast to expand_limits, expansion() is a helper function that is used with the expand argument of the discrete and continuous scale functions to add padding around the data. It accepts padding as a number of units or as a % of the range. expand_scale() seems to be an alias.</p>
<p>= Guides =</p>
<p>Guides are axes, legends, and colour bars. They are the inverse of scales: they provide a mapping from aesthetics to data; that is, a guide to interpreting plots. Guides are automatically generated based on aesthetic mappings.</p>
<p>Guides are mostly controlled via scale functions (e.g., the name, limits, breaks, and labels arguments). Additional control comes from the guide argument of scale, guides(), and guide_*() functions.</p>
<p>To suppress a guide element, set it to NULL.</p>
<p>Axis title can be controlled through xlab, ylab, labs, or an x|y scale function’s name argument. Legend and colourbar titles can be controlled via labs or the revelent aesthetic’s scale function.</p>
<p>Breaks are legend keys and axis tickmarks. Labels are the text that appear next to breaks.</p>
<p>If labels are set, breaks should also be explicitly set if there is a chance that the data could change. If the data changes, labels could be inappropriate for the changed default breaks. With numerical scales, you set the breaks and labels. With categorical data, you don’t set the labels. Instead you pass a named vector to labels, where the names are the data values and the values are the labels for the data values. (At least this is what the ggplot2-book.org examples demonstrate.) TODO: I wonder if it is possible to mix and match these different methods.</p>
<p>The labels and breaks arguments also accept functions. The breaks function accepts a length-2 vector of limits and returns a breaks vector of any length. The labels function accepts a length-n vector of breaks and returns a labels vector of the same length. The scales package provides several label formatting functions.</p>
<p>The minor_breaks argument is useful with e.g. log scales. See the example in ggplot2-book.org.</p>
<p>== Legends ==</p>
<p>In contrast to axes, legends can display multiple aesthetics (e.g. color and shape), from multiple layers, and the legend key/symbol depends on the type of geom used (e.g. point or line); additionally, legends’ position relative to the rest of the plot is configurable. These options are controlled through</p>
<p>Layers only appear in the legend if an applicable aesthetic such as shape or linetype is mapped to a variable in the layer’s data. This can be changed for a layer by show.legend. FALSE prevents it from appearing, while TRUE forces it to appear. E.g., aesthetics don’t show up in the legend if they are specified within a layer but outside of aes() (as when setting an aesthetic to a constant value), as in the first geom_point layer below:</p>
<p>{{{r ggplot(df, aes(y, y)) + geom_point(size = 4, colour = “grey20”) + geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 2)</p>
<p>ggplot(df, aes(y, y)) + geom_point(size = 4, colour = “grey20”, show.legend = TRUE) + geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 2) }}}</p>
<p>ggplot attempts to minimize the number of legends by combining aesthetics <em>for</em> <em>the same variable into the same legend key.</em> This behavior is controlled by the name argument of a scale. For merging to occur, the scales’ name must have the same value. Change name to split aesthetics out into their own legend. You can also use the same name to combine guides (of the same or different type) for different variables. See <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guides.html" class="uri">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guides.html</a></p>
<p>Some guide properties are specified through theme (e.g., legend.position, legend.box, legend.box.just).</p>
<p>Other properties are controlled through guides() and guide functions.</p>
<p>If you want aesthetics to be displayed differently in the legend than in the plot, see this example. The last line overrides the constant alpha of the plot with a different constant. Note that the name within guides (colour) is an aesthetic that has been mapped within aes to a data variable. My guess is that you could specify any of the aesthetics included in a legend, if there were more than just one aesthetic. Note also that the list of override.aes contains only an aesthetic previously given a constant value (alpha).</p>
<p>{{{r norm &lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(1000), y = rnorm(1000)) norm<span class="math inline">\(z &lt;- cut(norm\)</span>x, 3, labels = c(“a”, “b”, “c”)) ggplot(norm, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(colour = z), alpha = 0.1) + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) }}}</p>
<p>theme legend.position (position for bounding box) legend.box (how to stack legends within box) legend.justification (justification within bounding box) Legends specified for each aesthetic: scale_fill_continuous(guide = guide_legend()) guides(fill = guide_legend()) -&gt; helper function for guide arg of scale*(), similar to labs() guides guide_legend (discrete fill) ncol byrow reverse guide_colorbar (continuous fill)</p>
<p>The guides() function can be used to display the legend keys differently than the plot does. E.g., the plot may use a higher transparency value than you want in the legend.</p>
<p>WHAT ABOUT SHOW.GUIDE??????</p>
<p>= Facet =</p>
<p>Whereas many aesthetics create groups shown in the legend of a single plot and in the plot itself, the facet_* functions create groups by splitting the data between a number of plots shown on a grid.</p>
<p>= Scales =</p>
<p>Arguments to the continuous scale include name (axis or legend title), breaks (tickmarks or legend key), labels (break or legend key labels), limits, expand (padding), oob (behavior for data outside limits), na.value, trans (transformations for the data, e.g. log10 or reverse), position (l/r/t/b), sex.axis (secondary axis). Note from the examples that labels accepts transformation functions for numeric label formatting. See the scales package.</p>
<p>scale_[x|y]_discrete() works a bit differently with labels and limits when dealing with factors. The labels argument allows you to rename the axis labels by using a named vector. The names are the original values (in the data) and the values are the new names you’d like. The order determines order on the axis. Limits can be used to reorder a factor’s levels’ order on the axis and limit which ones appear, without renaming them (see labels). The reorder() function–see the help page examples–can also be used for reordering without using the scale function. Labels also accepts formatting functions like base::abreviate for factors.</p>
