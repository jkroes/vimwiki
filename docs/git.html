Clone repository located at <repo> to a directory named after the repository. Creates a remote named origin pointing to the repository. Sets origin/master as the upstream branch for master such that git push and pull on master use origin/master by default. If
<dir>
is omitted, a dir is created from the repository name. -o Change the remote name (<code>origin</code> by default). –bare Create a bare/remote repository from an existing repository This is roughly (not exactly) equivalent to <code>cp -Rf &lt;repo&gt;/.git &lt;dirname&gt;.git</code>.

<h2>Checkout</h2>
<p>git checkout – <paths> Discard modifications to <paths>. NOTE: Cannot be reversed. Even deleted branches or amended commits can be recovered, but not discarded changes that were never committed. <branch> Switch branches (i.e., point HEAD to <branch>). If <branch> doesn’t exist and exactly matches a name on only one remote, local <branch> will be a tracking branch for which remote <branch> is its upstream. In the latter case, this is shorthand for <code>git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code> -b <branch> [<object>] Create and switch to branch at <object> (by default HEAD). If <object> is a remote-tracking branch of the form <remote>/<branch>, the new branch will be a tracking branch with the remote-tracking branch as its upstream branch. <tag> Checkout tag in detched HEAD state –track <remote>/<branch> Shorthand for git checkout -b <branch> <remote>/<branch> where both branch names are the same.</p>

<div id="branch" class="section level2">
<h2>Branch</h2>
<p>git branch List branches (<code>*</code> indicates current branch) -v[v] Also list SHA-1 and message of commit for current branch [and (state relative to) remote-tracking branches]</p>

                                the current branch by default. Merged
                                branches are candidates for deletion.
&lt;branch&gt;        Create a new branch
-d &lt;branch&gt;     Delete a branch after merging. Fails if the branch has
                not been merged into HEAD, assuming it has no upstream

                            local branch</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="merge" class="section level2">
<h2>Merge</h2>
<p>git merge <branch> Merge <branch> into HEAD. Typically HEAD is the branch you want to keep after merging and use as the reference point for diffs in the merge-commit. E.g., if you are working on a parallel branch and want to periodically bring in changes from your main branch, checkout the parallel branch before merging. When you wish to merge the parallel branch into the main branch, check out the main branch. –squash <branch> Squashing takes all work on <branch> and squashes it into a single changeset, creating the equivalent of a merge without actually committing. You can do additional work before creating the actual commit. Once you commit, instead of having two parent commits, there will only be a single parent. The main differences between squash and rebase are 1) squash doesn’t create a commit right away, enabling further work before committing; 2) squash doesn’t delete the branch you squash; 3) squashing creates a single commit, whereas rebase replays all of your commits onto a different branch. Both, however, produce a linear commit history with a single parent.</p>
</div>
<div id="rebase" class="section level2">
<h2>Rebase</h2>
<p>git rebase <first> <second> Rebase second branch onto first (target) branch. After this, run <code>git checkout &lt;first&gt;</code>, then <code>git merge &lt;second&gt;</code></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="documentation" class="section level1">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<div id="configuration-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuration of git happens through .gitignore and .gitconfig. The latter can be edited via the <code>git config</code> command. This is also the command for creating command aliases.</p>
<p>These files can exist at the system (all users), global (current user), and local (repository) level. Local configuration overrides global, which overrides system configuration.</p>
<div id="gitignore" class="section level3">
<h3>gitignore</h3>
<p>Syntax: * standard globbing is recursively applied * <em>: Zero or more characters </em> []: One of the characters within brackets * ?: A single character * [0-9]: Characters within range (e.g., 0 through 9) * <strong>: Zero or more directories * E.g., a/</strong>/z matches a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, etc. * Beginning / avoids recursion * Ending / specifies directory * ! negates pattern * # comments</p>
<p>.gitignore files can be placed within subdirectories of repo. See man .gitignore for specifics.</p>

<div id="what-is-git" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Git?</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed VCS that stores a snapshot of repository state (i.e., file state) rather than file diffs.</p>
<p>Git operations are quick because they are done locally.</p>
<p>When you are ready to send local work to a remote repository, Git transfers your work via one of four protocols: http, git, ssh, and local. Most people interact with remote repositories through a repository hub like GitHub, using the http protocol, the repository’s URL, and user credentials to determine access permissions.</p>
<p>Git uses unique SHA-1 <a href="https://ericsink.com/vcbe/html/cryptographic_hashes.html">checksum-hashes</a> store and reference content. These serve as keys for data-lookup and as checks to ensure that data integrity is preserved.</p>
<p>Files have two Git states: tracked and untracked. Tracked files are those that have previously been committed and have not been explicitly untracked later.</p>
<p>A git-tracked file has three states: * Modified: File in the working tree has changes but isn’t committed. * Staged: Modified file has been marked for commit by inclusion in the index/staging-area file of the .git dir. A file can be both staged and modified if only some changes to it have been staged. * Committed: Changed file has been stored as an object in the .git dir. After this, new changes will make the file as modified.</p>
<p>The basic workflow of Git is:</p>
<p>Start or clone a repository <code>git clone</code> Edit files Add edits to be stored <code>git add &lt;paths&gt;</code> Commit edits <code>git commit</code> Add a remote <code>git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code> Fetch remote data <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</code> Merge in remote changes <code>git merge &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code> Push work to remote repo <code>git push</code></p>
<p>TODO: Add other basic commands like creating and checking out branches</p>
</div>
<div id="objects-and-references" class="section level2">
<h2>Objects and references</h2>
<p>Pointers: files that only contain the SHA-1 hashes of Git objects (e.g., commits). Seems to be a synonym for reference, but the latter term often seems to be used when describing specific types of pointers.</p>
<div id="objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>Git has various types of objects: * Blobs are basically files. * Trees are directories. They record pointers to the blobs (files) and subtrees within, as well as the names associated with each SHA-1 pointer. For files that haven’t changed since a previous commit, the pointer continues to point to the blob in a previous commit. * Commits are like repository snapshots. Commit objects record the author, committer, commit message, a pointer to the parent commit(s) (multiple for merges, none for initial commit), and a pointer to the root tree object of the snapshot.</p>
</div>
<div id="references" class="section level3">
<h3>References</h3>
<div id="tags" class="section level4">
<h4>Tags</h4>
<p>Tags are static pointers to commits. There are two types: * Lighweight: SHA-1 pointers to commits–like a branch but static * Annotated: Contain additional metadata and can be signed with GPG</p>
<p>Tags must be explicitly pushed to a remote, since they are not pushed by default.</p>
</div>
<div id="branches" class="section level4">
<h4>Branches</h4>
<p>Branches are lightweight, movable pointers to a commit. The default branch name is <code>master</code>. As you make commits, the current branch updates to point at the last commit made. So if you create a new branch, switch to it, and make a new commit, only the new branch will point to the most recent commit. Git tracks the current branch via the special pointer <code>HEAD</code>. To change the current branch, use <code>git checkout</code>.</p>
<p>Before switching branches, you either need to commit or stash changes. You can always do a <code>commit --amend</code> when you switch back, if you don’t want to stash.</p>
<div id="merging-branches" class="section level5">
<h5>Merging branches</h5>
<p>Branches are used by Git to split work into different topics or for different groups. Once the work is finished, it is typical to merge it into another branch via git merge. When the current branch is an ancestor of the merged branch, this is a fast-forward merge. No new commit is created, and the current branch moves up to point at the commit pointed to by the merged branch.</p>
<p>An example of fast-forward merging is the following: * <code>git fetch origin</code> * <code>git checkout master</code> * <code>git status</code>: branch is behind remote-tracking branch by N commits * <code>git merge origin/master</code></p>
<p>After merging a branch, it is typical to delete it. Its commits are recorded in history, and a new branch can be spawned at any point along the branch’s previous history if e.g. code fixes are later needed.</p>
<p>For two divergent branches with a common ancestor, a three-way merge is done and a new commit is created for the resulting snapshot.</p>
<div id="merge-conflict-resolution" class="section level6">
<h6>Merge conflict resolution</h6>
<p>If the branches to be merged have different changes to the same lines in a file, a merge conflict arises. To view which files have conflicts after a merge, run git status. Files with conflicts are listed as unmerged. Git adds conflict markers to the files. Open the files in an editor:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:index.html
&lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;contact : email.support@github.com&lt;/div&gt;
=======
&lt;div id=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;
 please contact us at support@github.com
&lt;/div&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iss53:index.html</code></pre>
<p>Replace these lines with the desired code. After exting your editor, Git asks if the merge was successful. If you say yes, git will stage the changes. Running git commit concludes the merge. Include a message that explains the rationale for the way you resolved the conflict(s).</p>
<p>If configured, git mergetool can be used to resolve merge conflicts.</p>

<div id="rebasing" class="section level5">
<h5>Rebasing</h5>
<p>Alternative to three-way merges. Rather than merging two divergent branches into a single descendant commit, you can apply the changes from the <branch> onto a target branch (e.g., master): <code>git rebase master &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
<p>“This operation works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you’re on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn.”</p>
<p>After rebase, you checkout the target branch and do a fast-forward merge to the commit created by the rebase and now identified by the branch that was checked out when you rebased (this branch was moved to the new forward commit). <code>git checkout master</code> <code>git merge &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
<p>Rebasing produces the same end commit but with a cleaner, linear log.</p>
<p>Complex rebasing is possible. E.g., a third branch sharing an ancestor commit with a second branch, and the ancestor’s parent is a commit in the master branch. This rebases only the commits unique to third (i.e., ignores the shared ancestor commit) onto master. <code>git rebase --onto master &lt;second&gt; &lt;third&gt;</code> <code>git checkout master</code> <code>git merge &lt;third&gt;</code> See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/rbdiag_e">this example</a></p>
<p>!!!Warning!!! Do not rebase commits that exist remotely, which others may have based their work on. The <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing#rbdiag_i">example near the bottom</a> contains a fix that may work if this occurs.</p>
<p>In general, rebase local changes that haven’t been pushed to maintain a clean history, and never rebase if you’ve pushed. If rebase isn’t avialable, there’s always merge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="remotes" class="section level4">
<h4>Remotes</h4>
<p>Remotes: Remote repositories, usually identified by a name that resolves to the repository URL.</p>
<p>Remote references: References contained in a remote repository.</p>
<p>Remote-tracking branches: Local references indicating the state of remote branches at the time of last network communication. Git moves them whenever you communicate with remotes via <code>git fetch</code>. Have the form <code>&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code>. Created automatically during cloning.</p>
<p>Remote branches: Sometimes used by Git Pro to indicate remote-tracking branches. Technically, remote-tracking branches track the state of remote branches, and inbetween running <code>git fetch</code>, the two may point to different commits.</p>
<p>Note that fetching doesn’t create a new local branch when new remote-tracking branches are created. (Fetching also does not modify working directory. You still have to checkout local branches from remote ones or merge in changes from the remote branches to existing local branches.) To checkout a branch from a remote-tracking branch, use <code>git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This new branch is known as a “tracking” branch. The remote-tracking branch is then known as the upstream branch. Enables <code>git pull</code> and <code>git push</code> on the tracking branch, without having to specify a remote or remote-tracking branch. Note that <code>git clone</code> automatically creates a tracking branch.</p>
<p>Shorthand for the above is <code>git checkout --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code>, which will cre<F13>ate local tracking branch <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Additional shorthand is <code>git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</code>, which creates a tracking branch if <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> doesn’t exist and exactly matches a name on only one remote.</p>
<p>If you already have a local branch and want to set or change its upstream branch: <code>git branch -u &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
<p>If you’re unsure whether your branches have an upstream branch: <code>git branch -vv</code></p>

<h2>Git on the server</h2>
<div id="transfer-protocols" class="section level3">
<h3>Transfer Protocols</h3>
<div id="local" class="section level4">
<h4>Local</h4>
<p>For when the remote repository is in another directory on the same host. Can be used e.g. for a team with access to a shared filesystem such an NFS mount. Cloning, pushing, and pulling can be done as usual, but there are two syntaxes.</p>
<pre><code>* `git clone /srv/git/project.git`
* `git clone file:///srv/git/project.git`</code></pre>
<p>Without the <code>file://</code> prefix, git clone operates as if the –local flag was passed: the contents of .git/objects are hardlinked, and the “Git aware” transport mechanism is bypassed. –no-local forces the regular Git transport. –no-hardlinks forces copying of .git/objects instead of hardlinking. The first syntax is faster than the second.</p>
<p>Because hardlinking creates a duplicate file pointing to the same inode (file contents), it should be safe to use hardlinks so long as no one deletes the remote repository on the shared drive. Deleting anything within the local .git/objects directory will simply delete the local file rather than the file contents.</p>
<p>Note that the local protocol uses existing file permissions and shared access settings. It may be slower to use the local protocol on a shared mount than to use the SSH protocol.</p>
</div>
<div id="http" class="section level4">
<h4>HTTP</h4>
<p>By default, smart HTTP allows users to pull and push from a single URL with user authentication enabled for either read or write access. Anonymous access is possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="ssh" class="section level4">
<h4>SSH</h4>
<p>Standard SSH syntax: git clone <a href="ssh://%5Buser@%5Dserver/project.git" class="uri">ssh://[user@]server/project.git</a> SCP-like syntax: git clone [user@]server:project.git If the optinal username is omitted, Git assumes the current user.</p>
<p>Unlike HTTP, does not support anonymous access to a Git repository that you self-host. To access, users need at least read access to the repository, but this may be a feature for internal corporate settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="git" class="section level4">
<h4>Git</h4>
<p>Similar to SSH without authentication. Uses a dedicated network port (9418). Requires some initial setup for each repository for the Git daemon to enable this protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-a-server" class="section level3">
<h3>Setting up a server</h3>
<p>For serving an existing repo: <code>git clone --bare &lt;repo&gt; &lt;dirname&gt;.git</code> This is roughly (not exactly) equivalent to <code>cp -Rf &lt;repo&gt;/.git &lt;dirname&gt;.git</code></p>
<p>Then from your local repoistory: <code>git remote add origin &lt;paren-dir&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;</code></p>
<p>For an empty server: <code>cd &lt;parent-dir&gt;</code> <code>mkdir &lt;dirname&gt;.git</code> <code>cd &lt;dirname&gt;.git</code> <code>git init --bare</code></p>
<p>Then navigate to where you want to create a local repo: <code>git clone &lt;path&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now you can push and pull to the remote.</p>
<p>You can alter filesharing permissions and send the repo path to whoever wishes to clone it. This works for shared drives atthe very least.</p>
<p>Inspired by: <a href="https://medium.com/@piteryo7/how-to-set-up-git-server-on-local-network-windows-tutorial-7ec5cd2df3b1" class="uri">https://medium.com/@piteryo7/how-to-set-up-git-server-on-local-network-windows-tutorial-7ec5cd2df3b1</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can setup SSH for certain users and manage their permissions. For shared drives, you probably don’t need SSH and can stick to the local transfer protocol. For SSH, see 4.2 onward of <a href="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GitHosting/article.html" class="uri">https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GitHosting/article.html</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on server setup with SSH, see Chapter 4 of Git Pro.</p>
<p>TODO: Can probably just copy the VOC inventory (git repo for scripts and all) entirely back and forth from D:, until others begin to collaborate on it. Then the repo needs to be setup as a bare repository on the shared drive, possibly even with SSH configuration. TODO: Does the local protocol apply to our shared drives at work? It should if they are NFS mounts. TODO: Look into setting access permissions from file browser and for different shells on Windows (but git-bash in particular) for a bare repository on a shared drive. If others are collaborating, we need some way to prevent them from modifying A:/VOC/Inventories from the file browser AND from the shell. Especially any git repos within there. TODO: When adding a remote on a shared drive, do I have to use the UNC paths (i.e., //dprhq01/…) or can I use drive letters? If the former, do I have to use pushd and popd to navigate in the shell? Test pushing and pulling within git bash after adding a remote repo on a shared mount to see if UNC paths work fine. TODO: For Windows git, make sure to select the option to “Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings.” TODO: Learn DVC (<a href="https://dvc.org" class="uri">https://dvc.org</a>) for data versioning</p>

<h2>Distributed Git</h2>
<div id="distributed-workflows" class="section level3">
<h3>Distributed workflows</h3>
<p>There are several Git development workflows.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Centralized workflow. Everyone pushes and pulls to and from a shared repository, and before pushing each developer needs to ensure their repository is at the latest state, or merge in the others’ changes, before pushing their own work.</li>
<li>A canonical repository exists. Most people have read access to this and write access to their own public copy of it. A contributor emails the canonical repo manager. The manager adds the contributor repo as a remote, tests their code, merges to their own local copy, then pushes to the canonical repo.</li>
<li>The second step can involve tiered management, in which one or more managers have sub-managers, and below this are topic developers. Sub-managers test and merge topic branches from developers, and managers do the same for sub-managers, pushing to the canonical repo when ready.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Contributing to a project</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project">section 5.2 of Git Pro</a> for detailed examples of developing with git, with images.</p>
<div id="private-small-team" class="section level4">
<h4>Private Small Team</h4>
<p>Someone pushes work to the remote, and you want to see what new commits they’ve introduced (i.e., what you’ll have to merge).</p>
<p><code>git fetch origin</code> <code>git log issue54..origin/master</code></p>
<p>This uses a log filter to get commits on the latter branch that are not on the first branch. Here, issue54 is a local branch you’re workign on. Note that the latter branch is a remote-tracking branch, which is why we ran git fetch first. This enables you to examine the work before merging it into your local repo. From here you would merge your topic branch into your local master, then fetch and merge the remote master branch, then push to the remote.</p>
<p>If you want to push a local branch to a remote branch of the same name and set the upstream at the same time: <code>git push -u origin &lt;topic&gt;</code></p>
<p>If two people have independently created branches for a topic (and likely given them different names), after pulling their branch down you could either merge your branch into theirs and push normally, or merge their branch (featureBee) into yours (featureB) and push your local branch to the differently named remote branch:</p>
<p><code>git push -u origin featureB:featureBee</code></p>
</div>
<div id="forked-public-project" class="section level4">
<h4>Forked public project</h4>
<p>Process used on GitHub where push access is restricted:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Clone the project</li>
<li>Do some work on a topic branch</li>
<li>On the project page, fork the project.</li>
<li>Add the forked remote: <code>git remote add &lt;remote&gt; &lt;fork-url&gt;</code></li>
<li>It’s usually easiest to push the topic branch rather than merging with the master branch and pushing that. (Note that -u is not be needed if you’re working alone from your fork or on this branch in your fork, because there will be no work to pull down. <code>git push -u &lt;fork&gt; &lt;topic&gt;</code></li>
<li>Submit a pull request on GitHub or run git request-pull and email the output to the project maintainer. The arguments to git request-pull are the remote branch (e.g., origin/master) you want to merge your topic branch into and the URL or shortname of your fork. <code>git request-pull &lt;remote-tracking-branch&gt; &lt;fork&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to work on multiple topics, don’t work from previous topic branches. Checkout the remote branch you want to base your work on, spawn a new topic branch, make changes, then submit a pull request. Only the changes particular to your new topic branch will appear in the pull request, and each request can be approved or denied without affecting the other requests.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">git</span> fetch origin
<span class="fu">git</span> checkout -b featureB origin/master
<span class="ex">...</span>
<span class="fu">git</span> push myfork featureB
<span class="fu">git</span> request-pull origin/master myfork</code></pre></div>
<p>If the original project tries to merge your work after some other patches, and the merge fails, you can fetch the newest features from the remote-tracking branch, checkout your topic branch, rebase on the remote-tracking branch, resolve the conflicts, and force push to your fork.</p>
<p>git push -f <remote> <branch>: When the branch being pushed is not a direct descendant of the branch already on the remote, a force push is required.</p>
<p>Or you can checkout a new branch based on the main project’s branch, then do a squashed merge of your topic branch rather than rebasing.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">git</span> checkout -b <span class="op">&lt;</span>branch<span class="op">&gt;</span> origin/master
<span class="fu">git</span> merge --squash <span class="op">&lt;</span>topic<span class="op">&gt;</span>
<span class="ex">...</span>
<span class="fu">git</span> commit
<span class="fu">git</span> push myfork <span class="op">&lt;</span>branch<span class="op">&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Squashing takes all work on the merged branch and squashes it into a single changeset. You can do additional work before creating the actual commit. Once you commit, instead of having two parent commits, there will only be a single parent. Crazy, right? The main differences between squash and rebase are 1) squash doesn’t create a commit right away, enabling further work before committing; 2) squash doesn’t delete the branch you squash; 3) squashing creates a single commit, whereas rebase replays all of your commits onto a different branch. Both, however, produce a linear commit history with a single parent.</p>
<p>If you don’t intend to pull-request your fork’s changes, you can still update your fork based on the main project. Anytime you want to incorporate changes from the main project, you can pull down the main project to merge with your fork, then push the result to your fork.</p>

<p>See the commits and their diffs (-p) in contrib but not master git log -p contrib –not master git log -p master..contrib This shows changes grouped by commit. What about all changes cumulatively?</p>
<p>git diff accepts a commit/branch to compare the working trees between the current and named commit. Say you want to compare a topic branch with the branch it was spawned from. If the original branch has moved forward, git diff will produce weird results. Assuming you’re on topic and topic was spawned by master, git diff master will appear as if you’re adding every change in topic and removing everything unique to master. But there’s another way.</p>
<p>To see all changes that would result from merging topic with master, you can find the common ancestor of the branches and find the difference between that and the topic git diff (git merge-base contrib master) contrib Or use the shorthand git diff master…contrib For git diff, the triple dots specify the changes the RHS has introduced since its common ancestor with the LHS</p>

<p>The double-dot syntax is limited to two refs. These are equivalent git log refA..refB git log ^refA refB git log refB –not refA But the latter two allow for more than two refs git log refA refB ^refC git log refA refB –not refC</p>

<p>git add -i: Interactive staging (see <code>man git-add</code>, “INTERACTIVE MODE”) * STATUS * UPDATE: Mix of STATUS and staging a whole file * REVERT: Unstage (or untrack) files: “… staged information for selected paths are reverted to that of the HEAD version.” * ADD UNTRACKED: Begin tracking a file * PATCH: Choose parts of a file to stage. Use ? to see available keypresses. * DIFF: Review what will be committed, similar to git diff –cached</p>
<p>Note that u and r select something to be (un)staged, but you have to type e.g. u<CR> 1,2<CR> <CR> to actually stage files 1 and 2. Between entering the numbers and pressing ENTER, and pressing the following ENTER, the files to be staged will be marked with asterisks to indicate they are selected for staging.

According to the last paragraph of this section in Git Pro, you can provide a regex to help Git match a function or method in your language. From the example given, it looks like you pass the starting and ending lines, surrounded by //, then surrounded by quotes if spaces are included, and separated by commas. E.g. git log -L ‘/unsigned long git_deflate_bound/’,/^}/:zlib.c Tells git log to look for changes between unsigned long git_deflate_bound and } within zlib.c.

<h1>Dates in git</h1>
<p>Dates in git are largely undocumented, but I found a random source exploring its bounds. Apparently it uses an internal library called approxidate. Source: <a href="https://alexpeattie.com/blog/working-with-dates-in-git" class="uri">https://alexpeattie.com/blog/working-with-dates-in-git</a></p>
<p>TL;DR: Dates are super flexible. The following work: * today * 2.months.ago * “last tuesday” * 10-12-2020 * “Apr 18 18:46:55 2020” * “Apr 18 2020 - 1 week”</p>
<p>These date formats can be passed to command flags like –since or –until, or they can be used with Git’s generic date filter: @(<date>)</p>
<p>E.g., git diff master@(“yesterday”) master@(“1 year 6 months ago”)</p>
<p>WARNING :Some date specs don’t seem to work, so try phrasing the same query multiple ways if you notice something odd.</p>
<p>WARNING: Git may guess dates incorrectly at times. E.g. git log –until= * 11.4.2020 * 4.11.2020 both showed me commits in my dockervim project up until Apr 9 2020. I’m not sure how to force a specific date format for input, so always check Git’s output against your input date. One way that seems to work is: * YYYY.MM.DD Test that this format is consistently interpreted as such.</p>
<p>WARNING: git log displays author date (date of original commit), while git log –since=<date> interprets its input as committer date (date patch was applied to the project). What other areas of git does this affect? To see committer date in the logs, use git log –format=fuller.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check for whitespace errors:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>git diff –check</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Keep commits small. If needed, stage only parts of a changed file:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>git add –patch</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Commit messages
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Limit subject lines to 50 characters or less</li>
<li>Blank line follows</li>
<li>Explanatory text wrapped at 72 characters or less. Write in the imperative mood: “Fix bug,” not “Fixed” or “Fixes bug.” Multiple paragraphs or bullet points can be separated by blank lines. Use hyphens or asterisks and hanging indents for bullets.</li>
</ol></li>

<div id="globbing" class="section level1">
<h1>globbing</h1>
<p>Glob special characters need to be escaped b/c both the shell and Git do filename expansion on globs. E.g., log/*.log matches any .log files within log/, while *~ removes files ending in ~.</p>
<p>Detached head state: New commits aren’t associated with a branch and can only be reached by the commit hash. You can avoid this by creating a new branch anytime you return to a previous commit to make fixes. Occurs when you check out a past commit without creating a branch. Why is it called this?</p>
<p>TODO: Write about this section onward TODO: Wrap git commands and keywords in cod tags. Using surround or search-replace? TODO: State-backed reopsitory hub available as GitHub alternative?</p>
