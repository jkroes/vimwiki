If you experience issues installing packages on Linux, ensure all the non-R
dependencies are installed, and if they are then try installing without a lock
file:

```{r}
install.packages(..., INSTALL_opts = '--no-lock')
```
In particular, xml2 often fails to install, crashing its reverse-dependency
tidyverse.
