# Views

Tables can be viewed in datasheet or design view. View can be changed from the
Home tab, Fields tab while in datasheet view, or the Design tab while in design
view.

## Design view

In this view, the table schema can be designed, including field name, data type,
and some field properties only displayed in this view (see the General and
Lookup tabs toward the bottom).

### General tab

Toward the bottom, the General tab shows metadata about the selected field such
as field size, default value, and validation.

### Lookup tab

The lookup tab shows information if the selected field is the lookup data type.
There are two types of lookups: table queries and (hard-coded) value lists. At
its simplest, a value list can be used to create a dropdown with a list of
values to choose from.  Note, however, that this does not provide validation as
non-enumerated values can still be typed in this lookup field.

# Data types

The most commin include text (long text for >255 chars), number, yes/no (see
format, since default is a checkbox), date/time, calculated field, attachment,
hyperlink, and lookup.

# Field properties

* Field size
* Format
* Input mask (data validation pattern)
* Default value
* Required: 'Yes' for requires a value in each record

## Input masks

Three semicolon-separated parts:
* Mask string, placeholders, and literal data
* Boolean (0 or 1) for whether to store displayed mask characters in data
* Whether to use hyphens instead of underscore as placeholder char

### Placeholders

* 0: Mandatory digit
* 9: Optional digit
* #: Optional digit, space, plus, or minus. If skipped, Access enters a space.
* L: Mandatory letter
* ?: Optional letter
* A: Mandatory letter or digit
* a: Optional letter or digit
* &: Mandatory character or space
* C: Optional character or space
* .,:;-/ Decimal and thousands placeholders, date and time seperators
* >: Converts following characters to uppercase
* <: Converts following characters to lowercase
* \: Characters immediately following are literal. Use to insert characters
  instead of placeholders.
* "": Enclosed characters are literal
* !: Apparently used to fill in a mask's rightmost characters first when
  optional characters are included in the mask. Note: The relevant example mask
  in the Microsoft docs say "left to right," but this description seems off
  based on their example value.

### Wizard

In the Design view, on the General tab, click Input Mask property box, then the
... button.

Select a mask type, then click Try it to generate a mask.

Or click Edit List to customize a mask.

# Validation rules

While masks specify the format, validation rules restrict the ranges of
permitted values for a field or entire record. You can also add a rule for a
form.

Used when input masks are insufficient (e.g., validating email addresses and
other strings with highly variable length and a few common characters such as @
and a period.

# Database design

One-to-many: E.g., suppliers and products, where multiple suppliers can't offer
the same product. Foreign key in one table is the primary key in another.

Many-to-many: E.g., orders may have multiple products, and products may be
included in multiple orders. To link these tables, you need a junction table
whose primary key consists of the primary keys from the products and orders
tables.

One-to-one: Useful to avoid empty space when some fields to apply to certain
records but not others in a table. Such tables share a primary key if the
subject is the same (e.g., products and supplementary product info); otherwise,
either one (but not both) of the tables requires a foreign key similar to a
one-to-many relationship.

Break fields into smallest possible units (e.g., regno consists of firmno,
prodno, subregistration, and ABN)

When information is being duplicated, consider splitting your table into several
tables.

Each column must describe the subject of the table; otherwise, it belongs in a
separate table.

Avoid storing calculations or derived fields in tables. Calculate/derive using a
calculated field or on-the-fly in forms. The latter options preserves 3NF.

1NF: Each cell consists of a single value, not a list.
2NF: Each non-key field depends on the entire key (when the key consists of
multiple fields).
3NF: Non-key columns are independent of each other.

# Copying data into Access

Access will set the data types of each field according to the data pasted, when
pasting into an empty table. Field names are pulled from the first row.

# Table analyzer

Available in Database Tools tab. Use to find redundant data that indicates a
need to split a table.
