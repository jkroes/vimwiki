# TODO

## Personal

Order tests from sutter
Ask about decreased student loan payments (before covid-19 deferment began)
Chair should ship on 22nd and arrive on 27th

## Neoterm

Toggling seems to simply delete the terminal window, rather than the terminal
buffer. Instead, it should return to the previous buffer if the behavior of
neoterm is to open a terminal buffer in the current window. Obviously, with
splits this doesn't matter. But you don't always want new splits, you just want
to swap out the buffer for a terminal temporarily, unless you're using the
terminal to open a file in that window. It may be that there are neoterm
settings you can tweak to make this happen.

## Floating terminals

These could be a solution to neoterm's current bad behavior. And possibly a
replacement for ranger.vim:

https://github.com/kevinhwang91/rnvimr
https://github.com/Lokaltog/neoranger (simple script that seems to store
previous buffer, like I'm hoping for neoterm)

Some of the above were provided by https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Integration-with-other-programs

# LSP

https://langserver.org
https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/b33lc1/a_guide_to_lsp_auto_completion_in_vim/
https://www.kieranbamforth.me/post/vim-lsp
Compare vim-lsp to coc.nvim to nvim-lsp to LanguageClient-neovim
vimscript https://github.com/iamcco/vim-language-server
    - Works with coc.nvim or with the other lsp client packages
R
    https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver
    https://github.com/neoclide/coc-r-lsp
    You could disable completion and rely on ncm-R for completion while still
    using an lsp server; however, you may need to disable nvim-r. But some of
    the nvim-r plugin should be replaceable with neoterm and the lsp
