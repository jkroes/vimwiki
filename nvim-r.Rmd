# Random notes

R_start_libs determines which packages' objects can be autocompleted prior to
loading the package. In contrast, library(...) will not offer a package as an
autocompletion until it has been loaded at least once in an nvim-R session.
E.g., library(tidyverse) subsequently enables completion of tidyverse, dplyr,
purrr, and the other user packages within tidyverse.
