title: "Vim regex"
---

Replace vimwiki titles with markdown titles interactively
```
:%s/\(=\+\)\( .* \)\(=\+\)/\=repeat('#', len(submatch(1))) . submatch(2)/
```
On a line of only dashes, type Vr=
```
:g/^-\+$/norm Vr=
```

With an R function and its named arguments selected, remove the names and move
arguments to the same line:
```
:'<,>'s/\n\s*[a-zA-Z_*]* =//
```
