# Synopsis

xargs [options] [command [initial-arguments]]

# Description

Reads items from standard input, delimited by blanks or newlines, and passes
them to command.

# Options

```
-0          Inputs items are terminated by a null character instead of
            whitespace. Useful when input items contain space, quote marks, or
            backslashes. GNU find's -print0 option produces such null-separated
            input.
-a file     Read items from file instead of stdin.
-d delim    Character separating input items. Can be a character, C-style
            character escape, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.
-E eof-str  The end-of-file string.
-p          Prompt
```
