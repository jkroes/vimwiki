# Curl

Curl does not work in WSL by default. Run the following code, extract
the last certificate in cacert.pem, and copy it over to
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:

```{sh, eval=F}
echo quit| openssl s_client -showcerts -servername api.github.com -connect api.github.com:443 > cacert.pem
```

Alternatively, you might be able to alias curl as
> curl -cacert /mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

As a last resort, run curl insecurely.
