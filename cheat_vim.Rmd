=       Indent selection
;;      Add align right comment

## R console

;rf         Start R
;rq         Close R
;rr         Clear console
;rm         rm() and clear console
;rd         setwd()
;:          ':RSend '
:Rinsert    :RSend with output insertion (up to 5012 chars)

## R objects

;rp     print()
;rn     names()
;rv     View() data.frame in new tab
;vs                      ... horizontal split
;vv                      ... vertical split
;rt     str()
;ra     args()
;rh     help(). If the first argument is positional and a variable, and if the
        function to get help on is generic (e.g., print or summary), help
        specific to the class of the first argument will be shown (e.g.,
        print.data.frame)
:Rh[elp]
;re     example()
;rs     summary()
;rg     plot()

# Object browser

;ro     Toggle
;r=     Expand all lists
;r-     Collapse all lists
ENTER   Toggle b/w Library and .GlobalEnv views when cursor is on first line of
        object browser, expand/collapse lists under cursor in .GlobalEnv, or
        view objects within a library

## Evaluation

Non-line evaluation consists of ;<object><action>

### Object key

a(ll, or file)
b(lock of lines between two marks)
c(hunk)
f(unction)
m(otion), followed by any motion
s(election)
p(aragraph)

### Non-motion action key

<first-letter> (current)
e(cho)
d(own, except for file)
a (echo and down, except for file)
h (all chunks above up to current line)
o(output insertion in tab for selection, or in .Rout for file depending on
  `R_routnotab`)

### Lines

;l(ine)
;d(own)
;q (newline)
;o(utput insertion as comment)
;su (all lines above)


## Help

;rh and ;rp shows class-specific help for functions based on the first argument
passed to a function (e.g., summary(lm(...)) vs summary(rnorm(...)), but only if
the first argument is positional and not named!

## Rmd

;gn     Goto next chunk
;gN     Goto previous chunk

### Knit

;kr     Markdown render default output
;kn     Knit (i.e., to .md)
;ks     Spin (knitting .R files!)

### LaTeX

NOTE: These may only work for Rnoweb documents. They don't work for Rmd.
TODO: Find a way to make Skim or Zathura work with .Rmd.

;op     Open PDF
;gp     Search forward synctex
;gt     Go to latex synctex

### Child documents

When the cursor is on an R chunk's header with the child option, sending a line
of code will knit the child document.
