# Introduction

What is R Markdown? 

> At itâ€™s core an R Markdown format consists of:
>
> 1. A set of knitr options that govern how Rmd is converted to markdown.
> 2. A set of pandoc options that govern how markdown is converted to the final output format (e.g. HTML).
> 3. Some optional flags and filters (typically used to control handling of supporting files).

First, note that many topics can be explored in tandem with the resources below by visiting the [CRAN page for R markdown][].

The links visible via [Rmarkdown v2][] that are relvant for future readings are listed below:

* Interactive Documents with Shiny, HTML Widgets, and Shiny Widgets describe how to make R documents interactive via Shiny
* Compiling Reports from R Scripts details how to compile documents from Rmd files without using R Markdown syntax
* Document Output Formats gives more details on compiling to specific formats. Note that I have already read the HTML page. It serves as a useful reminder on, among other things, shared options, extending YAML headers to include extra pandoc arguments, Rmd extensions (R Markdown is basically pandoc markdown with some add-ons), custom templates, and **external dependencies**. This latter may not be what you think (sourcing other scripts, for example). In this case, see [Reddit][]
* **R Markdown Websites** (creating websites from multiple Rmd files)
* Pandoc Markdown is a resource of secondary importance.
* The knitr package is a resource of secondary importance. 
* Other links of future interst include Document Templates, Creating New Formats, and Parameterized Reports.
* Formats > GitHub Document, **Tufte Handouts**, and R Markdown Notebooks
* Articles > Embedding RData files in R Markdown files for more reproducible analyses

Another package that may be of general interest is formatR.
