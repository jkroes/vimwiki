# Future topics:
  # Read the CRAN manual for info not given on Rmarkdown website
  # Read Cheat Sheet
  # Read Reference Guide (sections on markdown syntax, knitr chunks, and pandoc options)
  # Shared R scripts
  # Rmd partials
  # Site navigation
    # icons
    # _navbar.html (write your own html-based navbar)
    # Bootstrap documentation on navbar
  # html generation (including widgets)
  # htmltools (custom html generation). Need to decide if GH Pages can host a dynamic webpage.
