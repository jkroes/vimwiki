# Glob expansions (fish)

*: expands to any string without a /, including empty string

**: expands to any string (i.e., recurses into subdirectories), including empty string
Note that, unlike other shells, `**\/*.fish` will match files only in
subdirectories while `**.fish` will match in the  current and subdirectories

?: any single char except / (if qmark-noglob is disabled)

Exception: Wildcards do not match leading periods, so dotfiles and directories
can only be matched against a globbed string if it begins with `.`.

# Glob rules

All globs are implicitly anchored at the start and end

Unquoted globs are expanded.

A single globbed string is expanded to all matching filenames.

Expanded filenames are preserved as a single word, even if whitespace is present
in the filename.
