### Long-term

    * Script rewrites
        * Topics
            * Unadjusted emissions
                * Two scripts calculate unadjusted fumigant emissions differently,
                  one of which is used for adjusted emissions. Need to confirm that
                  scripts' results are the same for these fumigants, or else how
                  differences affect final inventory results and whether to rewrite.
                  See "D:\EmissionsCalcs.docx";
                  "D:\EmissionsCalculationAnalaysis.xlsx";
                  Compare_Unadjusted_Calcs.sas
            * Adjusted emissions (A/VOC/Procedures/Adjusted emissions.docx)
            * Errors in aggregated totals
                * Seen in AI and site-AI totals, and in differences between mebr
                  and nonmber datasets. See Rmarkdown report, roadmap, and
                  procedural document for report.

                  In general, aggregation should be done as late as possible in
                  the data process to avoid loss of information and unnecessary
                  early splitting of a dataset into multiples, which increases
                  the risk of truncation and other i/o errors. Aggregation
                  across one group of factors should be done only once for each
                  dataset.
    * SOP for updating inventory inputs
    * Script to identify Focus-4 products
    * Update flowchart to reflect new inventory process, once finalized
        * Add to inventory script git repo
