## Work Diary

    * Prepped for annual review with Maziar.
        * Copied Microsoft Planner to this diary entry
        * Updated task lists, especially short-term tasks
        * Reviewed work summary emails

### Summary of annual performance review

Minh would like to involve me in ARCGIS. He can send me ARB shapefiles for NAAs
and Maziar has an R script that sounds like it will map NAAs to counties. I may
be able to use these to update our inventory.

The new hire will most likely be sent to collaborate with me on the VOC
inventory, so I will have practice working with others on a project I am
familiar with. Maziar has noticed that I am easily frustrated when asked to work
on unfamiliar projects, especially with so much other work to do already. He has
avoided new, outside assignments.

TODO: Put a PPT presentaiton together on an evaluation database
TODO: Attach a vfile link to the PDF review they sent in advance of the meeting.

### Annual performance pre-review Q&A

    * Rate ourselves
        * 7/10 / C-
            * Bare minimum to pass.
            * Before the county lockdown, I wasn't taking care of myself in my
              personal life like I should have. Once the lockdown hit, things
              grew worse for a time. A large reason for that I learned recently
              is that I was spending too much of my non-work hours doing work on
              various projects. A lot of research into programming, system
              administration, new tools and editors I could work with. And it
              burned me out.
            * Another reason was that I wasn't on the right medication. But
              switching came with side effects that I had to overcome, so it's
              only been lately that I've been starting to feel more rested, more
              productive, and more alert.
            * Disorganization. Kept jumping between where and how I kept notes:
              Word wasn't working, paper notes didn't match the way I think and
              work. Microsoft Notes, Planner taken away. Finally found a
              solution that IT is not planning to take away.
            * Trouble adapting to changes in the inventory.
    * What you can improve
        * Task management and note taking
        * Work-life balance. Being more productive at work so that I don't need
          to spend as much of my leisure time working.
        * Collboration with others. I have kept to myself, and I need to reach
          out to more of the senior staff when I have the time.
    * Rate management
        * 8/10. Have been supportive of everything I've tried to do. Have given
          me freedom to work on the things I think are important.
    * Learn more about
        * Clean Air Act and how it affects the VOC inventory. No formal training
          that touches on this. How to do a SIP submission. E.g., 2018 changes
          to FFMs?
        * Rulemaking experience. OAL covered process, not substance. What I've
          used from the training I already mostly knew from my time as a Sci Aid
          when I spent a couple weekends in the State library.
    * Most proud of
        * Rmarkdown report. It required creativity, flexibility, and problem
          solving. I was able to discover past errors in report language and the
          values in data tables, I was able to build datasets for all of the
          report inputs--in some cases going back to the early 2000s (and
          1990)--despite inaccurate metadata about past years' source
          files/scripts. I learned how to weave together latex and rmarkdown
          creatively. And in all, it finally helped me understand what we were
          actually doing during this stage of the inventory. Previously, we had
          a workbook with dozens on dozens of sheets that had redundnancies and
          confusing cross-references. And the procedures were incomplete, so I
          did a lot of investigative work.
          It also showed me that I'm more productive when I jump headfirst into
          a task and experiment, rather than doing endless research trying to
          find all of the answers before I attempt a task. The latter has been
          the way I've always approached a task, but I don't think it will be
          any longer. I tend to learn better through doing, I've found.
        * Evaluation database template. I had previously created one during
          research into database normalization forms and bitemporal dbs, but
          never implemented it due to possible lack of IT support. With the
          request from Registration to change our forms, at least I already have
          a template ready that I can begin to fill out.
    * Goals for next year
        * Preliminary report markdown
        * Rewrite/refactoring of the annual report text? Seemed like Maziar
          wanted to work on it together when the time came.
        * Finish the rewrite of the inventory using git, R, and SQL.
        * SOP for inventory inputs and when and how to update them.
        * Conversion of script metadata to git logs. Changes are lost over time.
    * Priority projects
        * Report generation/revisions
        * Inventory script rewrites
        * Evaluation revisions and guidelines updates.
        * Conversion of past evaluations to new format (PDF history, not
          Brenna's suggested changes)
