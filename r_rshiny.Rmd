runExample("01_hello")

# WSL

shiny::runApp()'s launch.browser arg defaults to T during interactive use. This
triggers use of options()$browser, which is xdg-open on WSL. So either you can
set the option to something else in your site profile, or you can download
xdg-open-wsl. Or you can prevent reliance on the default by setting the SHiny
option shiny.launch.browser. See ?shinyOptions.

TOOD: Note that changing default-web-browser via xdg-settings failed, as did
changing $BROWSER to anything, including wslview. I will need to investigate the
relationship between $BROWSER, open, xdg-open, wslview, and update-alternatives
â€“config x-www-browser.

# Written Tutorial

# Basics

Make a directory dir/
Create dir/app.R:
    * load shiny
    * define ui and server
    * pass ui and server to shinyApp()
To run app.R, call runApp(<path-to-dir>)

# UI

fluidPage() creates a web page that resizes with the browser window.

Panels contain text, resources, wdigets, and an arglist of HTML elements created
by calls to Shiny's HTML functions (p, span, br, h1, etc.).

```{r, eval=F}
ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel(""),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(),
        mainPanel()
    )
)
```
## Resources

Shiny expects resources to be placed in dir/www/, including images and
stylesheets. E.g., img(src="file.png") adds dir/www/file.png to whichever UI
component contains the call (e.g., mainPanel()).

## Widgets

actionButton, checkboxGroupInput, checkboxInput, dateInput, dateRangeInput,
fileInput, helpText, numericInput, radioButtons, selectInput, sliderInput,
submitButton, and textInput.

Common required args are a name and label. Additional args are widget-specific.

## fluidrow and column

fluidrow() represents a single row of various height. It contains one or more
calls to column(width, ...), where ... determines which elements are contained
in the column and thus the height of the fluidrow.

# Reactives

# More details

Shiny runs app.R once.
server() is run once for each new user.
Reactives (render* functions) are run each time input changes.

In other words, source scripts, load libraries, and read data outside of the
server function to avoid repeated evaluation. Scripts and data are relative to
dir/ (the directory containing app.R).
